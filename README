This project aims to control a bot with a PC over an ethernet cable with help from the real-time video streaming from a camera on the bot.
This project adds video streaming to the Land-Rover project.

The bot consists of 2 dc motors for movement and a robotic arm with 4 degrees of freedom that can pick up small objects (upto 1” cube) carry it. The BBB drives the bot. A socket connection is established via an ethernet cable. The camera is connected to the BBB through the USB port. The video is streamed onto VLC Player.

The client code remains the same and runs on the PC(x86). The server code runs on the BBB.


The libraries needed for the server are downloaded as follows:

sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev
sudo apt-get install ivtv-utils
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

libv4l-dev is for camera control; ivtv-utils and ffmpeg are for enabling the streaming.


The libraries needed for the client are downloaded as follows:

sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev
or
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev

ncurses is for keyboard control.


The IP address of the connection to the PC should be changed in streamVideoUDP with the appropriate port no for video streaming.
The IP address of the connection to the BBB should also be changed in socet_client.cpp with the appropriate port no.
